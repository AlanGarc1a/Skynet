# Skynet

Skynet is a landing page website for a fictional company called Skynet from the Terminator movie series.

# Motivation

I was inspired to create the landing page for the main antagonist from the movie series while re watching the films. Also, since there are big tech companies now competing with each other to create the best artificial intelligence I wanted to create the original known one in the film industry.
